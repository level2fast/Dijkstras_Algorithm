# Dijkstras_Algorithm
This project implements Dijkstras shortest path algorithm in VB.NET with Visual Studio Community 2017 using a custom test data set I created based on a node tree used to represent the nodes. It features a custom built priority queue class I created to assist in making the algorithm more efficient. The application reads in the test data set and then prints the shortest path to each node in the tree to the command line. The results can be compared with the image of nodes below.
